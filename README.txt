 the plugin is very useful, i define it for the condition when we need to transform the datemodule to be the view,

normally, all the parameters in the view will be auto created to the simple view.

we can alse use annotion to change the mode of showing the parameter!  like (@ForceValidate  @IgnoreBind  @BindAttribute)

this will be used by demo whicn we can bind the data parameter to view , and we can simply change the module by edit the

view
